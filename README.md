# Stereo-Speaker-System-Turntable-With-Speakers-R612
The R612 has a stereo bookshelf speaker system, most notably its light weight and relatively small size, which saves a lot of space. While having two 15W external speakers, you can also experience its easy mobility and the retro design can be used as a great home decoration. Various functions are very easy to use and set up.
